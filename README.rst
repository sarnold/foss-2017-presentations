IoT Without a Net: A Practical Guide To Working With Microcontrollers The Open Source Way
=========================================================================================


Short
-----

The IoT world is here, and it isn't just Arduinos and RaspberryPis.  There are still
several families of microconroller architectures in wide use, however, there are also
significant differences and limitations to be aware of, including things like speed,
power consumption, and even stack size.  They also span a braod range of cost and
complexity, as well as compiler/tool support, both open source and vendor-specific.
Yes, this talk provides an overview of the landscape, but focuses mainly on several
specific hands-on examples of how to build, flash, and debug/test a modern IoT
microcontoller-based or hybrid device.
